# 🚀 Helios Quant Framework - Next Steps

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Infrastructure ✅
- Docker Compose with 9 services (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Go API, Next.js, Python, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Dockerfiles for all services
- Environment configuration templates
- New organized directory structure

### Documentation ✅
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - Complete technical documentation
- IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md - 4-month improvement plan
- GETTING_STARTED.md - Quick start guide
- REPO_STRUCTURE.md - New structure design
- REORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md - Migration instructions

### Scripts ✅
- Repository reorganization script (`scripts/utils/reorganize_repo.sh`)

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Clean Up & Reorganize (30 min)
```bash
# Run the reorganization script
chmod +x scripts/utils/reorganize_repo.sh
./scripts/utils/reorganize_repo.sh

# Verify structure
tree -L 2 services/
```

### 2. Test Docker Setup (15 min)
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api

# Stop when done
docker-compose down
```

### 3. Add Go Validation (1 hour)
```bash
cd services/api  # or go/ if not reorganized yet
go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10

# Edit cmd/server/main.go
# Add validation to Monte Carlo endpoint
```

### 4. Create First Tests (1 hour)
```bash
# Go test
cd services/api
cat > tests/health_test.go << 'EOF'
package tests

import (
    "net/http"
    "net/http/httptest"
    "testing"
)

func TestHealthCheck(t *testing.T) {
    req := httptest.NewRequest("GET", "/api/v1/health", nil)
    w := httptest.NewRecorder()

    // Call your handler here

    if w.Code != http.StatusOK {
        t.Errorf("Expected status 200, got %d", w.Code)
    }
}
EOF

go test -v ./tests/
```

## 🛠️ Quick Commands Reference

### Development
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Run Go API
cd services/api && go run cmd/server/main.go

# Run frontend
cd services/web && npm run dev

# Run tests
cd services/api && go test -v ./...
cd services/analytics && pytest
cd services/web && npm test
```

### Docker

docker-compose restart [service_name]

# Clean up
docker-compose down -v
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat: add distributed Monte Carlo"
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Commit Often**: Small, atomic commits are easier to review
2. **Test First**: Write tests before adding complex features
3. **Document as You Go**: Update docs with each feature
4. **Use Branches**: Never commit directly to main
5. **Keep It Simple**: Start with simple features, add complexity incrementally
